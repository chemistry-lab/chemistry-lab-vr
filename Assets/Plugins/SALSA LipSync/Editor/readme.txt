Overview:
Welcome to the SALSA LipSync Suite. The SALSA LipSync v2 suite has been completely re-written to provide more
flexibility, a much higher degree of perceived accuracy, and more advanced animation technologies for your character
models. Mix and match blendshapes, transforms, sprites, textures, etc. to create unlimited viseme and emote
expressions. Expression components can now be reused within and across modules without conflict. The Suite includes
three product modules to simplify 2D/3D lipsync, eye/head movement, and emote expression projects:

SALSA LipSync
Simple Automated Lip Sync Approximation provides high quality, language-agnostic, lip sync approximation for your
2D and 3D characters. Audio dialog files are processed in real-time with our new look-ahead technology to
reduce/eliminate timing lag. Audio processing works equally well with 2D or 3D audio configurations. Results are
superior to basic jaw bone animations, without labor intensive phoneme mapping.

EmoteR
The emote randomization engine works alone or along-side SALSA and Eyes to drive random, emphasis-timed, repeating,
or manual expression animations. Link with SALSA to add emphasis emotes with audio-based timing. Emotes are fired
with priority over other expressions and seamlessly blend in and out using our new QueueProcessing technology to
manage animation and overriding priority.

Eyes
Eyes focuses on eye, eyelid, and head animation and tracking. Allow your character model to randomly look around or
configure her to focus on a target object with advanced micro-movements to eliminate static, robot-stare. Take
control over vertical and horizontal saccade movements for more realism. And, if your model supports it, enable the
new eyelid tracking option for the ultimate animation nuance.

Thanks and enjoy! We look forward to seeing what you create.

Sincerely,
Team Minnow
